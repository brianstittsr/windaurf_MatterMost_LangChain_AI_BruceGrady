# LangChain Automation Platform

A comprehensive AI automation platform integrated with Mattermost, providing visual workflow building capabilities similar to N8N but powered by LangChain and OpenAI.

## Overview

The LangChain Automation Platform allows you to create sophisticated AI-powered workflows directly within your Mattermost environment. Build automations using a visual drag-and-drop interface, leverage AI agents for intelligent processing, and integrate with external services seamlessly.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Workflow Builder** - Visual interface for creating workflows
2. **Execution Engine** - LangChain-powered workflow execution
3. **AI Agents** - Specialized AI agents for different tasks
4. **Integration Layer** - Connects with Mattermost and external services
5. **Template Library** - Pre-built workflow templates

### Services

- **Main Application** (`langchain-automation/app.py`) - Flask + SocketIO server
- **Visual Builder** (`templates/workflow_builder.html`) - Web-based workflow designer
- **Database** - SQLite for workflow storage and execution logs
- **Integration** (`integration.py`) - Connects with OpenAI bot service

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the Platform

After deployment, access the automation platform at:
- **Local**: `http://localhost:5001`
- **Railway**: `https://your-langchain-automation.up.railway.app`

### 2. Create Your First Workflow

1. **Open the Workflow Builder**
   - Navigate to the automation platform URL
   - Click "New Workflow" in the sidebar

2. **Design Your Workflow**
   - Drag nodes from the palette to the canvas
   - Connect nodes by dragging from output to input
   - Double-click nodes to configure them

3. **Configure Nodes**
   - **Triggers**: Define when workflows start
   - **AI Agents**: Add intelligent processing
   - **Actions**: Perform external operations
   - **Conditions**: Add logic and branching
   - **Outputs**: Send results to Mattermost or webhooks

4. **Save and Activate**
   - Save your workflow
   - Set status to "Active" to enable execution

### 3. Bot Commands

Use these commands in Mattermost to manage workflows:

```
workflow list                    # List all workflows
workflow create "Name" "Desc"    # Create new workflow
workflow run "Workflow Name"     # Execute workflow
workflow status [execution_id]  # Check execution status
workflow help                   # Show help
```
